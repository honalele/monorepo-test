# Monorepo Test

This repository serves as a testing ground for monorepo code management structure. It demonstrates best practices for organizing and managing multiple projects within a single repository.

## Overview

A monorepo (monolithic repository) is a version control repository that contains multiple projects or applications. This structure offers several benefits:

- Shared code and dependencies
- Consistent tooling and processes
- Simplified dependency management
- Easier code reuse
- Unified versioning

## Repository Structure

```
monorepo-test/
├── packages/           # Shared packages and libraries
│   ├── common/        # Common utilities and shared code
│   └── ui/            # Shared UI components
├── apps/              # Application projects
│   ├── web/          # Web application
│   └── mobile/       # Mobile application
├── tools/            # Build tools and scripts
└── docs/             # Documentation
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/monorepo-test.git
   cd monorepo-test
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

## Development

### Adding a New Package

1. Create a new directory in the `packages/` folder
2. Initialize the package with `npm init` or `yarn init`
3. Add necessary dependencies
4. Update the root `package.json` to include the new package

### Adding a New Application

1. Create a new directory in the `apps/` folder
2. Set up the application using your preferred framework
3. Configure the build and development scripts
4. Update the root `package.json` to include the new application

## Scripts

- `npm run build` - Build all packages and applications
- `npm run test` - Run tests across all packages
- `npm run lint` - Run linting across all packages
- `npm run clean` - Clean build artifacts

## Best Practices

1. **Package Management**
   - Use workspaces for managing dependencies
   - Keep shared dependencies at the root level
   - Use consistent versioning across packages

2. **Code Organization**
   - Maintain clear separation between packages
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Document shared interfaces and APIs

3. **Version Control**
   - Use conventional commits
   - Maintain a clear branching strategy
   - Keep commit history clean and meaningful
